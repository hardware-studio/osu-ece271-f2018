\section{Introduction}

\textit{Video graphics array} (\textit{VGA}) is a graphics standard for video display controller first introduced by IBM in 1987. VGA can be used to display a wide range of resolutions and refresh rates. VGA draws on the monitor from left to right and top to bottom. Each pixel is controlled by three analog pins for red, green, and blue (RGB) channels. Although VGA can control a wide range of resolutions and refresh rates, the 640x480 60Hz configuration is commonly used.

For the DE10-Lite, each of the RGB channels is a 4-bit port. The red, green, and blue channels connect to pins 1, 2, and 3 of the VGA connector, respectively. The horizontal sync (hsync) and vertical sync (vsync) signals of the FPGA connect to pins 13 and 14 of the VGA connector, respectively. Hsync and vsync are active-low. When hsync goes to 0, the next line starts to draw; when vsync goes to 0, the drawer goes back to the top of the screen again, starting a new frame. Figure~\ref{fig:de10_lite_vga_pinout}.

\section{Design}

The timing sequence of an VGA controller is as follows: the pixels are displayed from left to right and top to bottom. When all the pixels of the active resolution are displayed, there is a blank period called the \textit{front porch} which signaling the start of a \textit{sync pulse}. When the front porch period finishes, the sync pulse itself is toggled from HIGH to LOW (the sync pulses are active-low). This sync pulse signals the "reset" of the xy counter: the hsync pulse resets the xy counter to the left most of the next line, whereas the vsync pulse resets the xy counter to the top left of the screen. After sync pulse period finishes, the sync pulse is toggled back to HIGH for a period of time called the \textit{back porch}.

Figure~\ref{fig:640x480_60hz_vga_timing_sequence} shows the VGA timing sequence for the 640x480 resolution with 60 Hz refresh rate.
